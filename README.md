Here is the pubslihed link to the website I created for Cherry Bomb, a literary arts organization at the University of Pittsburgh: 
https://ellagrant.github.io/webs2022spring/. While I'm tempted to go into detail about what Cherry Bomb is and what we do, I think the website does
a better job. I hope you enjoy learning more about this club and checking out the fantastic writing and art submissions we've received and will
soon be published in our first edition!
