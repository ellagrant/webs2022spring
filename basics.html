        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>

        <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
            an ordered list</li>
        </ol>
        <!--above = block-level elements (aka "flow content," always drawn on a new line)-->
        <!--can also use in-line (aka "phrasing content", can affect elements of text anywhere in a line) -->
        
        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
        phrase.</p> <!--italics-->

        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
            of a word or phrase.</p> <!--bold-->

        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p> <!--italics and bold-->

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

        <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>    
        <p>Regards,<br/>
        The Authors</p> <!--<br/> makes line break, writing in a new line creates a space-->

        <hr/> <!--adds horizontal line-->

        <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
        soon.</p> 
        <!--trailing slash (/) for empty elements is optional-->
