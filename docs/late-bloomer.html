        i never learned how to french braid.<br/>
        i cut all of my hair off at twelve so i missed out on the years you learn to tuck and weave.<br/>
        i’m always a bit behind, i’m always trying to catch up.<br/>
        i hooked up with boys during the years i thought i was supposed to<br/>
        seeking clarity, repair, self-matinence, an orgasm.<br/>
        i faked it. all of them. all of me.<br/>
        i wanted to believe a mid-twenties second puberty could be on the horizon.<br/>
        one that contained the ability to do pretty braids. the ability to fuck men and like it.<br/>
        and a manufactured golden girl would hold my place until my day to be normal came along.<br/>
        but then, there was you.<br/>
        you braided the pieces of me i couldn’t construe, you held me up to the mirror of what you saw.<br/>
        i wasn’t a late bloomer, i just had to be watered by someone else.<br/>
        i was beautiful, with you<br/>
        i was okay, with you<br/>
        i was on time, with you.<br/>
        i was a hobby, for you<br/>
        i filled the savior complex, for you<br/>
        i let you destroy me so i could be rescued, by you.<br/>
        and now my sudden ability to see you outside the world we had, leaves me unsure of what was.<br/>
        i know i should hate you, but my biggest discovery includes your exploration.<br/>
        how do i forget you when the only time i understood myself was on your lips?<br/>
        finally understanding that no amount of time will turn me into the girl who fucks boys.<br/>
        and regardless of badly i need to, i’m afraid to lose the only person that loved the late parts of me.<br/>
        I feel like I’ve missed out on toxic and confusing love in the teen years.<br/>
        Because now, it feels like everyone demands the healthy kind of love,<br/>
        and i’m 14 again, obsessed with pretty mean girls.<br/>
