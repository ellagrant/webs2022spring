In my preview, I'm showing you the basic layout for my webpage. As I noted in my proposal, I'm creating a website for Cherry Bomb, a literary arts magazine at Pitt. 
We are a relatively new club, having only been created fall 2021, and we do not have an official website yet. I'm the club's business manager, and I've
worked very hard with the other officers and club members to get the ball rolling, get funding, recruit members, and start putting together our first edition of the magazine! I'm really proud of how far we've come, and can't wait for the release of our first edition in (fingers crossed) mid-April 2022.
I'm hoping that the website I will create for class will inspire further web design when we actually get started on ours. For time's sake, I don't imagine
us using HTML and CSS to create our website, but the knowledge of web design and layout from this unit will be really helpful regardless.

So far, I have my index, which shows the logo at the top and has tabs for "about," "visual art," "writing," "calendar," and "contact us." Each of those pages
are partly completed in terms of content, some more than others. The writing and visual art pages include writing submissions from Pitt students that
will go in the magazine. All of the writing submissions have their own page that the user can navigate to, but I still have to get around to making individual 
pages for each art piece. The main thing for me to focus on going forward is style. I have some basic styles down, like background color, font size, type,
and color, some dimensions, and link attributes, but I still have a long way to go in making it look how I want. I'm trying to go level by level (ie applying
all style elements I learned from part 4 of the tutorial, then all elements from part 5, then part 6, etc.), but sometimes I find it easier to go page
by page. I don't really have a system as towards how I'm going about this, but I've been successful so far, so I think whatever I'm doing is working.

My main obstacle, and I would really appreciate feedback on this, is how I'm going to do the poetry pages. I currently have each poem copied into
an individual HTML document. However, going through each poem one by one and formatting them according to the link breaks/format of the original
submission will be very time-consuming and laborious in HTML and CSS, especially if I plan to incorporate not just the line breaks but the spacing.
As a writer, I feel that it is essential to maintain the artistry of the original works, so I plan to copy the original format as closely as I can, but
I would prefer to do so in an easier way than going through each line. The only other option is including images of the poems instead of including them
as text, but I don't want to do this. I think it would look messy and unsophisticated, and I want the user to be able to interact with the writing
submissions as they would with any other text on a website. 

Otherwise, I'm confident in my project going forward. I still have to figure out exactly how I want it to look, but that's a lot of trial and error that
I can figure out as I go and try different things.
