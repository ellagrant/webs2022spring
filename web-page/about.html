    <h1>- About -</h1>
    <p>We are Cherry Bomb Lit Mag, a student-run organization at the University of Pittsburgh!
      We are a relatively young organization, created in fall 2021 by a group of students passionate
      about art, writing, poetry, and all things creative. We welcome and encourage all Pitt 
      students to submit their art and writing-- you can check out some of our submissions under
      the 'Visual Art' and 'Poetry tabs.' Ideally, we plan to create and publish two literary arts
      magazines per year- one for fall semester, and one for spring semester- that are composed of
      selected art and writing samples.

      Our goal is to encourage the creative expression of students. We strongly believe that everyone
      should have the opportunity to create, explore various art forms, and be able to showcase their
      skills and hard work.
