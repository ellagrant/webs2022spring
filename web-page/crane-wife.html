    <p>For numberless turns of the moon, I had sat<br/>
        in the softness of bluegrass, plucking myself<br/>
        
        of feathers as my capillaries had burst<br/>
        like applause along mottled expanses<br/>
        
        of gooseflesh, my loom spinning out<br/>
        your silk fortune until you came<br/>
        
        upon my prayer on this night<br/>
        of power. For twelve unfruiting<br/>
        
        years, I had performed this courtship dance unknown<br/>
        to you, even as it had been killing me. I want to say<br/>
        
        look around at what my secret sacrifice has brought<br/>
        us, but already your face is shuttered, your body<br/>
        
        taut like a bowstring and, there is irony in that—how your once<br/>
        perfect earth seems to be growing smaller and larger<br/>
        
        all at once.<br/>
        
        Acts I thought benevolent, you think betrayal. I feel it<br/>
        now—the weariness of competing with a world that will not end.<br/> 
        
        The maiming arrow tipped<br/>
        with hemlock you knock back in half<br/>
        
        loving hope, half blind horror tears a hole<br/>
        in time, in the lashing rain that stretches<br/>
        
        like a newborn galaxy between us yet we both<br/>
        know that hope is the thing with feathers. As I plunge<br/>
        
        out of this life as your wife into the warm canvas of pink<br/>
        dawn, my first ratting bugle calls in more than a decade come<br/>
        
        out like a string of pearls as I look back and see<br/>
        myself in the gold shards of your eyes.<br/>
        
        Who is remembering whom?<br/>
