    <h1> "Self-Portrait as The Crane Wife," Jocelyn Saunders</h1>
    <p>For numberless turns of the moon, I had sat
        in the softness of bluegrass, plucking myself
        
        of feathers as my capillaries had burst
        like applause along mottled expanses
        
        of gooseflesh, my loom spinning out 
        your silk fortune until you came
        
        upon my prayer on this night
        of power. For twelve unfruiting
        
        years, I had performed this courtship dance unknown
        to you, even as it had been killing me. I want to say
        
        look around at what my secret sacrifice has brought 
        us, but already your face is shuttered, your body
        
        taut like a bowstring and, there is irony in that—how your once
        perfect earth seems to be growing smaller and larger 
        
        all at once. 
        
        Acts I thought benevolent, you think betrayal. I feel it
        now—the weariness of competing with a world that will not end. 
        
        The maiming arrow tipped
        with hemlock you knock back in half 
        
        loving hope, half blind horror tears a hole 
        in time, in the lashing rain that stretches
        
        like a newborn galaxy between us yet we both 
        know that hope is the thing with feathers. As I plunge
        
        out of this life as your wife into the warm canvas of pink
        dawn, my first ratting bugle calls in more than a decade come
        
        out like a string of pearls as I look back and see 
        myself in the gold shards of your eyes.
        
        Who is remembering whom?
