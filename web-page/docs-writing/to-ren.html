    <h1>"To Ren," Theo Segura</h1>
    <p>To Ren

        The weak, feeble light
        shambled down from
        the clear winter sky
        to fall clumsily upon
        the dirty surface
        of your little blue coat
        as we shuffled lazily on
        down the narrow, snaking path
        toward the slumbering park.
        You had asked me
        if I still remembered
        how to get there
        after having been 
        gone for so long,
        and I couldn’t help
        but let out a laugh
        that echoed in
        the liquid depths
        of your innocent, 
        brown eyes,
        and rang in the
        sterile chill of the
        afternoon. I miss
        the small weight of
        your hand in mine
        as we traversed
        the dull expanses
        of suburbia, and
        it is only now,
        sitting alone on the
        barren bed in the
        heavy silence and thick 
        shadows that cling to the
        empty walls of this
        prison cell of a room,
        suspended in the hazy past,
        that I realize the lure of the
        park wasn’t the real reason
        you left your toys behind
        in careless disarray
        to venture out with me
        into the clutches of 
        the bitter cold,
        because if it was,
        you wouldn’t have been
        so ready to go home
        as soon as I complained
        that my hands had
        begun to grow numb.
