    <h1>"Nomad," Ella Grant</h1>
    <p>
        Uprooted, ever yet, you and me,<br/>
        And these plans I made<br/>
        For me and you.<br/>
        Mountaintop, I will pack my boots, and you in your bright red hat,<br/>
        And race me down! Our wooden skis rattling like chestnut skeletons.<br/>
        One day,<br/>
        All else will fade, and we- you, me- will be bare as bones,<br/>
        And from your hands, covered in earth, and dirt, and hurt,<br/>
        Grows a home<br/>
        An always-moving sliver of sleep,<br/>
        A crescent moon hung high on the back porch from which we hang upside-down like monkeys,<br/>
        And I twist to look at you, because in a world of topsy-turvy,<br/>
        Like the house turned on its head, you are upright and beautiful as ever!<br/>
        And gravity is a chain that pulls at my hair, and blood collects in my eye sockets.<br/>
        When we are ready<br/>
        We will retreat downward<br/>
        Into the grasp of the desert’s sweaty claw.<br/> 
        Dear, I’d trade it all, the film of memory<br/>
        Wound tight as yo-yo unreleased,<br/>
        Trade our wings, our wagons, erase any migratory trace of the Old Life,<br/>
        And into sand we could sink, and our bones would become sand too,<br/>
        You, and me, and perhaps this is fate,<br/>
        Me, and you, deeper now, and I would grab your hand,<br/>
        And your effervescent, butterflying, unceasing smile,<br/>
        Stretched East to West,<br/>
        Still luminous on a face undead.<br/> 
        
        
        
        
        </p>
