    <h1>"To Ren," Theo Segura</h1>
    <p>

        The weak, feeble light <br/>
        shambled down from <br/>
        the clear winter sky <br/>
        to fall clumsily upon <br/>
        the dirty surface <br/>
        of your little blue coat <br/>
        as we shuffled lazily on <br/>
        down the narrow, snaking path <br/>
        toward the slumbering park. <br/>
        You had asked me <br/>
        if I still remembered <br/>
        how to get there <br/>
        after having been  <br/>
        gone for so long, <br/>
        and I couldn’t help <br/>
        but let out a laugh <br/>
        that echoed in <br/>
        the liquid depths <br/>
        of your innocent,  <br/>
        brown eyes, <br/>
        and rang in the <br/>
        sterile chill of the <br/>
        afternoon. I miss <br/>
        the small weight of <br/>
        your hand in mine <br/>
        as we traversed <br/>
        the dull expanses <br/>
        of suburbia, and <br/>
        it is only now, <br/>
        sitting alone on the <br/>
        barren bed in the <br/>
        heavy silence and thick  <br/>
        shadows that cling to the <br/>
        empty walls of this <br/>
        prison cell of a room, <br/>
        suspended in the hazy past, <br/>
        that I realize the lure of the <br/>
        park wasn’t the real reason <br/>
        you left your toys behind <br/>
        in careless disarray <br/>
        to venture out with me <br/>
        into the clutches of  <br/>
        the bitter cold, <br/>
        because if it was, <br/>
        you wouldn’t have been <br/>
        so ready to go home <br/>
        as soon as I complained <br/>
        that my hands had <br/>
        begun to grow numb. <br/>
