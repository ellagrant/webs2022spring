      Do you think—<br/>
      hold on lemme clear my throat…<br/>
      do you think it was<br/>
      that the hill was too steep<br/>
      or the stone too unwieldy<br/>
      for Sisyphus to crest,<br/>
      undress, and rest peacefully?<br/>
      
      I contend it was destiny,<br/>
      Yes, I see, a full-throated<br/>
      Cheer for destiny. He said<br/>
      To me, you know he said--<br/>
      
      He opened his mouth and<br/>
      he said “We are legion”<br/>
      and thousands of people<br/>
      poured forth from new regions.<br/>
      Respected and next to your bed,<br/>
      In the closet, the well-prepared<br/>
      Devil makes off with the prophet.<br/>
      
      And profit makes perfect,<br/>
      Or so I’ve been coddled<br/>
      You’ll be lucky to make it<br/>
      With wallet unfondled.<br/>
      
      
      I need more words than this<br/>
      With which to build more worlds than this.<br/>
      
      In a beeline for freedom I<br/>
      Mix rum with Darjeeling and<br/>
      vomit<br/>
      shut up<br/>
      tip the portents of my mind<br/>
      out of teacup-skull<br/>
      onto paper. And in this way<br/>
      I leave myself notes for later.<br/>
      
      I wish I could write one million<br/>
      Words and make them all feel<br/>
      Filling, like a chronically depressed<br/>
      Bob Dylan. Basically,<br/>
      I would like to be Bob Dylan.<br/>
      
      You baroque your ribs<br/>
      On backhanded compliments<br/>
      And meant to say more about<br/>
      Your development since.<br/>
      
      I baroco my poems and feel<br/>
      Like a goose, nevertheless I believe<br/>
      That I leave enough clues.<br/>
      
      I take cues from the Shaman of<br/> 
      Kesswill, shadowboxing Olympian.<br/>
      By the time I’m thirty-one<br/>
      I think I’ll reach one million.<br/>
      
      I need more words than this,<br/>
      With which to build more worlds than this.
