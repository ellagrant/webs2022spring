    <h1>"Unbidden," Liam Wiexel</h1>
    <p>Unbidden

      Do you think—
      hold on lemme clear my throat…
      do you think it was
      that the hill was too steep
      or the stone too unwieldy
      for Sisyphus to crest,
      undress, and rest peacefully?
      
      I contend it was destiny,
      Yes, I see, a full-throated
      Cheer for destiny. He said
      To me, you know he said--
      
      He opened his mouth and
      he said “We are legion”
      and thousands of people
      poured forth from new regions.
      Respected and next to your bed,
      In the closet, the well-prepared
      Devil makes off with the prophet.
      
      And profit makes perfect,
      Or so I’ve been coddled
      You’ll be lucky to make it
      With wallet unfondled.
      
      
      I need more words than this
      With which to build more worlds than this.
      
      In a beeline for freedom I
      Mix rum with Darjeeling and
      vomit
      shut up
      tip the portents of my mind
      out of teacup-skull
      onto paper. And in this way
      I leave myself notes for later.
      
      I wish I could write one million
      Words and make them all feel
      Filling, like a chronically depressed
      Bob Dylan. Basically,
      I would like to be Bob Dylan.
      
      You baroque your ribs
      On backhanded compliments
      And meant to say more about
      Your development since.
      
      I baroco my poems and feel
      Like a goose, nevertheless I believe
      That I leave enough clues.
      
      I take cues from the Shaman of  
      Kesswill, shadowboxing Olympian.
      By the time I’m thirty-one
      I think I’ll reach one million.
      
      I need more words than this,
      With which to build more worlds than this.
